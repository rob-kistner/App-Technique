Applying Base Presets
=====================

This workflow can be followed when you want to apply a basic overall correction preset -- like one of the [VSCO Lightroom Agfa or Fuji film presets](https://vsco.co/store) to out-of-camera raw shots.

---

### Pre-Apply

- **White Balance**: Set all shots in the series like you would normally
- **Lens Correction**: to all shots if applicable
- **Tranformation Corrections & Cropping**: maybe, maybe not. Transformation definitely helps but you might want to wait on cropping
- **Snapshots**: *Cmd+N* any shots you might want to revert at this point. Call the snapshots Base and use it, as it sounds, as a base corrections setting

---

### Apply

Now apply the setting. Look specifically after application for...

- **Highlight / white blasting**: correct where needed, batch if needed. May require brush application corrections
- **Shadows filling in**: also correct where needed, at this point, may require brush application corrections
- **Remove effect noise**: if you aren't going for the truly-filmic look, remove the noise completely
- **Sharpen as needed**: sharpening might be built in to some presets. Normally I'd say replace it with your own sharpening. *NOTE:* if the preset is applying it's own sharpening and noise reduction, I'd remove it and overwrite the preset, presets should NOT apply those two things to shots.
